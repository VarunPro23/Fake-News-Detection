# Fake-News-Detection
We will build an ensemble model consisting of the top 3 classifiers used to detect fake news using ML.

The top 3 classifiers are Logistic Regression, Decision Trees and Naive Bayes. Our ensemble model will use these 3 classifiers combined. We build the ensemble model using the stacking method.

The datasets used for this project are also available.
